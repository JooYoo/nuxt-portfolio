  "For Frontend Development, the critical point is, to understand the needs of the user, then rendering the data as friendly as possible. UI/UX design matters to me and I am a big fan of Minimalist Design. I like to think about how users would use the software in different scenarios. I hope the software I developed helps users solve their problems efficiently and satisfactorily.",
