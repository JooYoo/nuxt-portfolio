  "Hello World. Yu (朱瑜) is here. A Software Developer who is passionate about App Development in both native and web. I’m currently working at Liebherr, responsible for the development of the B2C, B2B iOS apps for the company.",
  "The critical point of app development is, to understand the needs of the users, then render the data as friendly as possible. UI/UX design matters to me and I am a big fan of Minimalist Design. I like to think about how users use the app in different scenarios. I want to develop apps that not only help people solve problems, but also provide a delightful user experience.",
