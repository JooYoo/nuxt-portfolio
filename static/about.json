  "Hello World. Yu (朱瑜) is here. A Software Developer who is passionate about Frontend Development and Mobile App Development. I'm currently working at Liebherr, responsible for developing and maintaining of the <a class=\"external-link external-link--liebherr\" href=\"https://home.liebherr.com/de/deu/de/home/startseite.html\" target=\"_blank\">🛒 Liebherr Appliances eCommerce Website</a>.",
  "For Frontend Development, the critical point is, to understand the needs of the user, then render the data as friendly as possible. UI/UX design matters to me and I am a big fan of Minimalist Design. I like to think about how users would use the software in different scenarios. I hope the software I developed helps users solve their problems efficiently and satisfactorily.",
  "Mobile apps are so fascinating. Because apps are so small and yet so powerful. Small enough to put in people's pockets, but powerful enough to solve all kinds of problems in life. I started to learn iOS development at the end of 2021. Being an iOS developer has always been my dream. I want to develop apps that not only help people solve problems, but also provide a delightful user experience.",
